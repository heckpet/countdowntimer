Early Retirement Countdown Timer

In anticipation of my upcoming early retirement, I wanted to create an electronic tape measure that would show the remaining working days. A little bit development with PHP and I achieved what I wanted. Nothing big, earth-shattering, but maybe helpful for one or the other application!

Variables to adopt:

1. $startDate - either leave on value or change to own one
2. $endDate - provide end date
3. $holiday - provide array of dates, you are not working / public holidays
